        <!-- Chapter Title -->
        <h2>Introduction to Me</h2>

        <!-- Paragraph 1: Introduction (class="intro") -->
        <p class="intro">I was born and raised in a small town called Hayward. It is know as the heart of the bay for some. I spent my childhood
            riding bikes, playing sports, and hanging out with my friends.
        </p>

        <p>I have always been fascinated by technology and computers. From a young age, I loved playing video games, 
            but my interest soon shifted to learning how these games were made. 
            I spent hours watching tutorials online and practicing through freecodecamp.
        </p>

        <p>I come from a large family with three siblings, and I love spending time with them. 
            Although we don’t always agree on everything, family is important to me.
             I enjoy weekend family gatherings, where we have dinner.
        </p>

        <p>I also enjoy going to the gym. Going to the gym has helped me release stress and overall improve my health.
            I usually spend my time at the gym for about 3 hours and I need to learn how to cut down on those hours.
        </p>
